nulocks-core
============

nulocks - NUmerical bLOCKS is a modular and customizable clone of 2048 game in C++. This is a repository with core engine of the game.

The main purpose of Nulocks is to provide an engine of a game similar to original 2048 and an option to visualize it in any interface you want to implement it in. This repository contains this very engine that can be used to implement 2048 and/or use extended Nulocks possibilities such as determined by user size of the board and ending level of block in any user interface you want.

If you want to contribute, start with the documentation at: http://www.phitherek.mooo.com/doxy/nulocks-core/. I would be happy to see Nulocks implemented for many platforms in many graphical libraries.
